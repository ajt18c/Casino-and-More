HOW TO PLAY


_______     BlackJack   _______

The goal of Blackjack is to have all your cards total to as close to 21 without going over as possible.
Aces count as 11 or 1, depending on which is more beneficial. Face cards all count as 10. 
On a player’s turn, they may “hit” (draw) as many cards as they want until they “bust” (go over 21), 
or the player may “stand” (keep their current cards). 
The dealer plays last and each player’s cards are compared to the dealer’s cards to determine if they won. 
Any player who gets a higher total value than the dealer, without busting, wins. 
If the dealer busts, then every player who did not bust wins. 
There may be 1-3 players, besides the dealer. 
This is chosen in the settings menu (if 4 is chosen, then the players will default to 3). 
A status bar will tell you which players turn it is and who has won. 
A new game may be started by clicking the button labeled “NEWGAME”.



________   Solitaire   _______

Objective: The first objective is to release and play into position certain cards to
build up each foundation, in sequence and in suit, from the ace through the king.
The ultimate objective is to build the whole pack onto the foundations, and if that
can be done, the Solitaire game is won.

Card Values: The rank of cards in Solitaire games is: K (high), Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A (low).

The Deal: There are four different types of piles in Solitaire:

The Tableau: Seven piles that make up the main table.
The Foundations: Four piles on which a whole suit or sequence must be built up. In most Solitaire
games, the four aces are the bottom card or base of the foundations. The foundation piles are hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs.
The Stock (or “Hand”) Pile: If the entire pack is not laid out in a tableau at the beginning
of a game, the remaining cards form the stock pile from which additional cards are brought into play according to the rules.
The Talon (or “Waste”) Pile: Cards from the stock pile that have no place in the tableau or on foundations are laid face
up in the waste pile.

To form the tableau, seven piles need to be created. Starting from left to right,
place the first card face up to make the first pile, deal one card face down for the next six piles.
Starting again from left to right, place one card face up on the second pile and deal one card face down on piles
three through seven. Starting again from left to right, place one card face up on the third pile and deal one card face
down on piles four through seven. Continue this pattern until pile seven has one card facing up on top of a pile of six cards
facing down.

The remaining cards form the stock (or “hand”) pile and are placed above the tableau.

When starting out, the foundations and waste pile do not have any cards.

Game Play: The initial array may be changed by "building" - transferring cards among the face-up cards in the tableau.
Certain cards of the tableau can be played at once, while others may not be played until certain blocking cards are removed.
For example, of the seven cards facing up in the tableau, if one is a nine and another is a ten, you may transfer the
nine to on top of the ten to begin building that pile in sequence. Since you have moved the nine from one of the seven piles,
you have now unblocked a face down card; this card can be turned over and now is in play.

Continue to transfer cards on top of each other in the tableau in sequence. If you can’t move any more face up cards,
you can utilize the stock pile by flipping over the first card. This card can be played in the foundations or tableau.
If you cannot play the card in the tableau or the foundations piles, move the card to the waste pile and turn over
another card in the stock pile.

Continue to transfer cards in the tableau and bring cards into play from the stock pile until all the cards are built
in suit sequences in the foundation piles to win!



________   American Roulette   ________

Wheel: Virtually all American casinos use a double-zero roulette wheel which has pockets numbered from 1 to 36, plus 0 for a total of 37 pockets.

Betting: You can make a straight bet where you only bet on one number and if it comes in you'll be paid 35-to-1.
The casino advantage on this bet is 5.26% and by the time you're done with this roulette section I'm sure you'll be very familiar with that number.

Another choice you have is to do a split. This is where you put a chip on the line that separates two numbers.
If either number comes up you'll be paid at 17-to-1. The casino advantage on this bet is 5.26%.

If you put a chip in an area that splits 4 numbers this is called a corner bet and if any one of those 4 numbers comes in you will be paid off at 8-to-1.
The casino advantage on this bet is 5.26%.

If you put a chip at the beginning of a row of 3 numbers, this is called a street bet and if any one of those 3 numbers shows up you will be paid off at 11-to-1.
The casino advantage on this bet is 5.26%.

You can also put a chip on the line between two streets so that you have a double street covered and if any one of those 6 numbers
come in you. ll be paid off at 5-to-1. The casino advantage on this bet is?... you guessed it...5.26%.

Red or black - If you put a chip on red then a red number must come up in order for you to win. If the ball lands on a black number, 0 - you lose.
The same thing goes for black - you lose if it comes in red, 0 and you win if the ball lands on a black number.

Odd or even - If you put a chip on odd then the ball must land on an odd number in order for you to win. If it lands on 0, or an even number - you lose.
If you bet on even, you win if an even number shows up and lose if the ball lands on 0 or an odd number.

1 through 18 and 19 through 36(high or low bet) - If you bet on 1 through 18, then you win if a number from 1 through 18 comes in and you lose if the ball 
lands on 0 or a number higher than 18. Similarly, if you bet on 19 through 36, you win if one of those numbers comes in and you lose on 0 or any 
number lower than 19.

The last bet to look at is the column bet and that is also a bet that pays 2-to-1. There are three possible column bets you can make and you'll
notice that each area corresponds to the numbers in the column directly above it. So, if you put a chip under the first column you will win if any
of the numbers in that column come in and you will lose if any other number, including 0 shows up.
